# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a modern, fast, and content-focused blog website. The primary goal is to provide an excellent reading experience and an easy-to-manage platform for publishing articles. The target audience is developers and tech enthusiasts. The blog's value comes from high-quality technical content and a clean, minimalist design.

# Core Features (MVP)
- **Homepage:** Displays a paginated list of the most recent blog posts with titles, summaries, and publication dates.
- **Article Pages:** Each blog post will have a unique, SEO-friendly URL. The page will render the article content from Markdown (MDX) files, including formatted code blocks.
- **Content Management:** Articles will be managed as local MDX files within the project repository. This allows for version control and a simple, developer-centric workflow.
- **Basic Navigation:** A simple header with links to "Home" and an "About" page.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout will be fully responsive and optimized for reading on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **SEO Foundations:** Automatic generation of meta tags (title, description) for each article page to ensure good search engine visibility.

# User Experience
- **User Persona:** The primary user is a "Curious Developer" who discovers the blog through search engines or social media. They value well-written, scannable content and a fast, ad-free reading experience.
- **Key User Flows:**
  1. A user lands on the homepage and sees a list of recent articles.
  2. The user clicks on an article title and navigates to the article page.
  3. The user reads the article.
  4. The user navigates back to the homepage or to the "About" page.
- **UI/UX Considerations:** The design will be minimalist, prioritizing typography and readability. A clear visual hierarchy will guide the user through the content.

# Technical Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) for its performance benefits and hybrid rendering capabilities.
- **Rendering Strategy:** Static Site Generation (SSG) for all blog articles and the homepage to ensure fast load times and excellent SEO.
- **Content Source:** Articles will be stored as `.mdx` files in a `content/posts` directory. A helper utility will parse these files, extract frontmatter (metadata like title, date), and provide the content to the Next.js pages.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling approach, allowing for rapid and consistent design implementation.
- **Deployment:** The site will be deployed on Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js, automatic deployments, and global CDN.

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP Requirements:**
  - Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Create the main application layout, including a simple header and footer.
  - Implement a utility to read and parse MDX files from the filesystem.
  - Develop the homepage to fetch and display a list of all posts.
  - Create dynamic routes to render individual blog posts.
  - Style the homepage and article pages for a clean, readable experience.
  - Create a simple "About" page with static content.
- **Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):**
  - Search functionality.
  - Categorization and tagging system.
  - RSS feed generation.
  - Comments section (e.g., using Giscus or a similar service).
  - Light/dark mode toggle.
  - Newsletter subscription form.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize the Next.js project and configure base dependencies.
2.  **Layout & UI Shell:** Build the main layout component, including navigation. This provides the visual structure for all pages.
3.  **Content Pipeline:** Develop the logic to read and parse MDX files. This is the core dependency for displaying any content.
4.  **Article Page:** Create the dynamic page for rendering a single post. This validates the content pipeline.
5.  **Homepage:** Build the homepage to list all posts, which depends on the content pipeline being functional.
6.  **Static Pages:** Add the "About" page.
7.  **Deployment:** Deploy the MVP to Vercel.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Scope creep; adding too many features to the MVP.
  - **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the core features defined in this PRD. Defer all non-essential features to the "Future Enhancements" list.
- **Risk:** Over-engineering the content parsing logic.
  - **Mitigation:** Use well-established libraries like `gray-matter` and `next-mdx-remote` to handle MDX parsing, rather than building a custom solution from scratch.
